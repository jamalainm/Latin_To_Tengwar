# Latin_To_Tengwar

This is a relatively dumb substitution algorithm, but it seems to accurately interpret the traditional Latin transliteration of Quenya and output the characters that the Annatar Tengwar font uses to represent those sounds and letter combination in Quenya.

## Usage

transcribe_sentence(foo)

print(transcribe_sentence(bar))

## To-Do

Add support for punctuation.
